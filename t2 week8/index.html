        <h3>Reference & Inspiration</h3>

       

        <div class="image-container">
        <img src="11.jpg" alt="An image of Taylor swify">
        <img src="22.jpg" alt="An image of Taylor swify">
        
        </div>
        <p class="em-text red-text">My dream space is very simple and very vulgar. It is also the most unpretentious wish of mankind, which is to have endless money! So I want to make a house full of money, which can also be an exhibition hall</p>

         <h3>Initial Modeling</h3>
         <div class="image-container">
         <img src="1.png" alt="An image of Taylor swify">
         <img src="6.png" alt="An image of Taylor swify">
         
    
         </div>
         <p class="em-text red-text">This is my initial modeling in blender. I imagined a circular exhibition hall with a bench in the center. There were many, many dollars piled on the bench, and some dollars were scattered on the ground. There were also dollar posters on the wall. </p>

        </div>

        <h3>Texture</h3>
        <div class="image-container">

        <img src="5.png" alt="An image of Taylor swify">
        
   
        </div>
        <p class="em-text red-text">This is the effect of adding textures. I also added the walls of the exhibition hall. </p>
       
 
         <div class="image-container">

         <h3>Final look</h3>
         <div class="image-container">
         <img src="7.png" alt="An image of Taylor swify">
         <p class="em-text red-text">This is the effect of importing the final model from blender to unity. </p>
        

          <h3>House in Terrain</h3>
         <div class="image-container">
         <img src="8.png" alt="An image of Taylor swify">
         <img src="17.png" alt="An image of a Taylor swify" id="specialImage">
         </div>
         <p class="em-text red-text">This is how the house I modeled looks like when I place it into the terrain, with the white showroom surrounded by lush trees in a valley.</p>

         <img src="10.png" alt="An image of Taylor swify">
         <img src="9.png" alt="An image of a Taylor swify" id="specialImage">
         </div>
         <p class="em-text red-text">Here I learned how to make an object pushable, starting with the cylinder in class and using it on the money roll. I want to place some money rolls that can be pushed in the exhibition hall to make me feel more involved.</p>
        
            <h3>interactive part2</h3>
         <div class="image-container">
         <img src="12.png" alt="An image of Taylor swify">
         <img src="11.png" alt="An image of a Taylor swify" id="specialImage">
         </div>
         <p class="em-text red-text">The part circled in pink is the pushable money roll I set up. There are three at the birth point and four in the exhibition hall.</p>
