        <p class="em-text red-text">In my vision for the future, the world I contemplate leans towards extinctionism. In a society where resources are increasingly scarce and the gap between rich and poor widens, the wealthy control the resources. Therefore, I want to take 'The Matrix' as my inspiration, where the protagonists, among others, live their lives in 'pods,' always believing that to be the real world.</p>
