    <h1>Digital Materiality</h1>
    <h2>Project Brief</h2>
    <p> For this project, I will use TouchDesigner to create a total of 6 different types of visual effects, and include 20 unique variations.
    </p >
    
    <h2>01. Particle Motion</h2>
    <p>For the first variation, I changed the "fractal" and "noise" settings, and added the "bloom" image filter. I created a total of 5 different versions.
    </p >

    <h2>02. Water Ripple</h2>
    <p>For the second iteration, I experimented with "edge" and "blur", making a total of 5 different edges and blurs. I also adjusted the "seed" and "period" within the "noise" function to create 3 variations.
    </p >

    <h2>03. Butterfly</h2>
    <p>For the third image, I adjusted the gradient color using the "ramp" tool, and experimented with "feedback", "transform", and "level". Within the "level" option, I manipulated "Gamma" and "Invert" to achieve a floating effect. I created 3 variations.
    </p >

    <h2>04. Sphere Dynamics</h2>
    <p>For my fourth design, I created a sphere and used noise and fractal functions. I also added lines and experimented with the transform function to create 5 variations. I found it interesting to change the dots to lines.
    </p >

    <h2>05. Acid Liquid</h2>
    <p>For my fifth design, I created an effect of acid liquid. Also played with "feedback", "noise", "level", and using "null". Total 3 variations.
    </p >

    <h2>06. Donut</h2>
    <p>For my final design, I created a donut and box particles and they will interact with the music I inserted. The music I played is from my favorite DJ illenium.
