        <h1>Music Mood Interaction!</h1>
        <h3>Share your current mood</h3>
        <p class="em-text">This is a website where you can communicate with others through music. Listening to the same music, everyone's feelings are different - it could be joy, sadness, or indifference. But it's precisely because everyone is different that the music mood interaction emerges! Through this website, you can experience the diverse emotions of others and engage in subtle communication.</p>

        <p class="em-text">Let's start the experience next! On the left is the music playing. On the right is a Hexagon Radar Chart. You can drag the red dot to adjust the value according to your mood at this moment. Remember to press the save button. These generated graphs are the moods of other people listening to music with you!</p>
